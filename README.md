Protects selected pages on your WP website with a one-time-password system

## Description

Protects selected pages on your WP website with a one-time-password system. The best use-case is for users who have control over their own email domain. 
This is because the main way to allow/disallow users in the system is by email domain. You can open the system up to all kinds of attacks by simply allowing all 'gmail.com' (for example) email accounts

## Usage notes

### OTP Plugin Options

#### Reset the plugin by deactivating and then reactivating:

The settings of the following - the WP pages generated by the plugin, the DB table created by the plugin; and the Cron jobs associated with clearing the DB -
Are only set when the plugin is activated. That means that if you would like to make changes to any of these areas, 
please deactivate the plugin, make your changes and the reactivate the plugin to see your change.

#### Cookie Usage:

In order for this plugin to function properly on your website, the cookie `PHPSESSID` needs to be a whitelisted or 'strictly necessary' cookie. 
This is only necessary if your site has a plugin that handles/cleans cookies. The logging in feature will not work if this cookie is not allowed to be used

#### Allowed Email Domains:

Example format: "gmail.com", don't include @ sign. Not intended to be open to everyone. Could create large demand on your email service if not taken care of well. 
Future work to create other ways to manage allowed users

#### HMAC Encryption Server Secret:

This must be a randomly generated string of numbers and letters at least 32 characters long and no longer than 64 characters

#### ReCaptcha:

This plugin can use ReCaptcha to mitigate malicious users taking advantage of your site. You can set up a ReCaptcha account to create a server key and a site key [here] (https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/enterprise)

#### SMTP: 

This plugin makes use of WordPress' `wp_mail` function. So setting up your SMTP service can be done on our options page and will be used to issue emails from the plugin
